This application helps to manage Library DVDs System 
The implementation of different Data structures and Search algorithms is the highlight of this project (binary tree, array, binary search, linear search)  
Besides, it also utilizes OOP.

It also demonstrates my abilities to:  
- use Git 
- clean code 
- follow coding convention
- implement atomic functions
